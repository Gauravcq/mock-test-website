    "question": "A lent ₹5000 to B for a duration of 2 years and ₹3000 to C for a period of 4 years, both at the same simple interest rate. In total, he received ₹2200 as interest from both borrowers. What is the rate of interest per annum?",
    "options": ["10%", "12%", "15%", "17%"],
    "correctAnswer": "10%",
    "explanation": "Let $R$ be the rate of simple interest per annum. The total interest received is the sum of interest from B ($SI_B$) and interest from C ($SI_C$).\n\nThe formula for Simple Interest is $SI = (P \\times R \\times T) / 100$.\n\n1.  **Interest from B ($SI_B$):**\n    $$SI_B = (5000 \\times R \\times 2) / 100 = 100R$$\n\n2.  **Interest from C ($SI_C$):**\n    $$SI_C = (3000 \\times R \\times 4) / 100 = 120R$$\n\n3.  **Total Interest:**\n    $$SI_{Total} = SI_B + SI_C$$\n    $$2200 = 100R + 120R$$\n    $$2200 = 220R$$\n\n4.  **Solve for R:**\n    $$R = 2200 / 220 = 10$$\n\nTherefore, the rate of interest is **10%**."

    "explanation": "The area ($A$) of a circular disc is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$. A percentage change in the radius affects the area through a **successive percentage decrease**.\n\nLet the original radius be $r_1$ and the original area be $A_1 = \pi r_1^2$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the new radius ($r_2$):**\n    The radius is decreased by $10\%$, so $r_2 = r_1 (1 - 0.10) = 0.90 r_1$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the new area ($A_2$):**\n    $$A_2 = \pi r_2^2 = \pi (0.90 r_1)^2 = \pi (0.81 r_1^2)$$\n    $$A_2 = 0.81 (\pi r_1^2) = 0.81 A_1$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the percentage decrease in area:**\n    The new area ($A_2$) is $81\%$ of the original area ($A_1$), which means the decrease is $100\% - 81\% = 19\%$.\n\n    $$\\text{Percentage Decrease} = \\frac{A_1 - A_2}{A_1} \\times 100\% = \\frac{A_1 - 0.81 A_1}{A_1} \\times 100\% = 0.19 \\times 100\% = 19\%$$\n\n**Alternatively, using the Successive Percentage Change Formula:**\nFor an area, the percentage change is calculated as $x + y + (xy/100)$, where $x$ and $y$ are the percentage changes in the two dimensions (radius is multiplied by itself, so $x=y$). Since it's a decrease, $x = y = -10\%$.\n\n$$\\text{Decrease} = (-10) + (-10) + \\frac{(-10) \\times (-10)}{100} = -20 + \\frac{100}{100} = -20 + 1 = -19\%$$\n\nThe negative sign indicates a **19% decrease** in the area."
